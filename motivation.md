**Questions**

This project develops tools for quantifying racially polarized voting in elections at all levels of the US government. Better measurement of racially polarized voting will empower organizations like the ACLU, NAACP, and thousands of local community groups to begin their own legal battles against vote dilution. To this end, we seek to answer the following questions:

1. How can we manage the noise and missing data that propagates uncertainty throughout our estimates of racially polarized voting?
2. How can we produce informative, comprehensible, and compelling visualizations of our results that can be used in court?
3. How do we integrate or use other sources of data (i.e. twitter, newspapers, school data, housing information, etc.) to improve data-driven evidence?
4. How do we ensure ethical consideration and practices while creating tools that use identifiable information?
